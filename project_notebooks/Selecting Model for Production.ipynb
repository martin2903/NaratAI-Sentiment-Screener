    "## This notebook is meant to familiarize the reader with the procedure of selecting the final model to be used for the purposes of the application\n",
    "- The training process was repeated four times (available in the 'BERT Fine-tuning' notebook) and four differrent models were exported. The models could only be trained on news headlines and news sentences as there are no labelled databases of news articles' bodies(refer to the 'Model data Generation and Exploration' notebook). Even if such were available, hardware limitations would still prove prohibitive of using entire articles for training the models. Consequently, some measure of their perfromance when classifying entire news articles must be implemented. In that manner, the models' performance coupled with the logic used for evaluating long sequences is tested which is crucial in arguing for the correct funtioning of the application. Considering the aforementioned, the described models' performance is judged not only based on the evaluation metrics extracted in the 'BERT Fine-tuning' notebook but also on the results they generate when scoring the custom dataset (described below). The model that performs best on the custom dataset will be the one used in production. Additionally, the wrongly guessed observations by the best performing model will be scrutinized to explore the weaknesses of the model.\n",
    "### The notebook is organized as follows:\n",
    "- The first four cells contain the functions that were built for the application's sentiment extraction functionality. For the ease of the reader they were included in the notebook as well. \n",
    "- Custom dataset exploration\n",
    "- Evaluation of the models\n",
    "- Final model choice\n",
    "- Wrong guesses exploration\n",

The argument for that choice is that very often an article would have one or two highly negative or positive paragraphs and then an additional 2 or 3 that are more informative and are evaluated as neutral. Despite the fact that the given article clearly tries to convey a negative/positive connotation, it would be evaluated as neutral.Through reducing the neutral probabilities, articles that indeed contain neutral discourse are not falsely evaluated because their negative and positive probabilities would still remain low and will not have an impact on the final evaluation. On the other hand, in cases where the neutral probability just slightly exceeds the positive or negative one due to the described characteristics of news texts, the given article will not be misclassified as neutral. \n",
